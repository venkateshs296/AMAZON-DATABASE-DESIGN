# AMAZON-DATABASE-DESIGN

In this project, Amazon e-commerce Database design is implemented using Oracle SQL. Functional requirements are analysed and relationships are identified between entities. Then based on this , Enhanced ER diagram was drawn. Relational schema diagram was then drawn based on the relationships and entities identified. Later, tables were created with proper constraints. Finally, necessary stored procedures and triggers were created based on the functional requirements.
